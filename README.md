Welcome to the Language of your Dreams (Not Really)
*** Language N ***

The language in its initial stage is built to handle these basic :
1. Variables and function declaration
   1.1 Data Types (int, char)
2. Syntax is " " <space> separated
3. Display realtime errors if any in the console with highlighting line number

During compilation, our language interpretor parses and tokenises the N language code and using various expression checks and error handling,
the N code is converted to the respective C++ code.
This C++ code is then further compiled to finalise and execute our N code.
